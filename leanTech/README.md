**README for Playwright Test Suite**

_Overview_

This repository contains a Playwright-based test suite that automates the customer flow for the Sauce Demo application. The test covers login with multiple users, selecting random items, verifying cart functionality, and completing the checkout process.

The test suite uses Playwright with TypeScript and implements the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for maintainable and scalable test automation.

_Prerequisites_

Before running the test suite, ensure you have the following tools and dependencies installed on your system:

_Node.js_

Ensure you have Node.js installed. The recommended version is LTS (>=16.x).
Download and install Node.js from Node.js Official Website.

_Playwright CLI_

Playwright provides a CLI tool for installation and running tests.
Install Playwright globally by running the following command:

bash
npm install -g playwright

_Git_

Ensure Git is installed to clone the repository.
Download Git from Git Official Website.

_Environment Variables (.env)_

Create a .env file in the root directory and provide the following user credentials and password:

STANDARD_USER=standard_user
LOCKED_OUT_USER=locked_out_user
PROBLEM_USER=problem_user
PERFORMANCE_GLITCH_USER=performance_glitch_user
ERROR_USER=error_user
VISUAL_USER=visual_user
PASSWORD=secret_sauce

_Installation Steps_

_Documentation_

Test Suite Highlights
Technology Used: Playwright with TypeScript
Design Pattern: Page Object Model (POM)
Scope:
Login with multiple user roles.
Select three random items and verify cart functionality.
Checkout flow with valid and invalid scenarios.
Navigate back and forth between pages.

_Acknowledgment_

This test suite was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT by OpenAI. ChatGPT was instrumental in:

Designing the Page Object Model (POM) structure.
Creating iteration logic for multiple user logins.
Handling corner cases for cart and checkout functionalities.
Explaining test automation concepts and best practices.
